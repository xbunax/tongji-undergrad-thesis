## Contents

* source files: as a template repository, "source files" are ".typ", ".bib" and some related files with other extension names.
* doc files: including all ".typ" files and even "main.typ", which show how to use "source files".
* config files: These files make our development and use of templates more standardlized (e.g. .gitignore).

## How to contribute

### How to ask for help?

Providing conditions where people ask for help and solve problems is also part of community. We hope to provide technique support in [Discussions](https://github.com/TJ-CSCCG/tongji-undergrad-thesis-typst/discussions).

It has to be **NOTICED** that: **DO NOT CONTACT WITH ANY CONTRIBUTOR THROUGH IM**!

### How to report a bug?

If a bug is confirmed, you can raise it in the [Issues](https://github.com/TJ-CSCCG/tongji-undergrad-thesis-typst/issues).

We recommend to follow this workflow step by step:

1. Fork this repository as upstream repository.
2. Clone the repository forked from remote to local.
3. Create a new local branch as a work branch.
4. Commit some changes on the work branch.
5. Push the new local branch to remote with commits.
6. Pull request, from the new remote branch to any branch of upstream repository.
